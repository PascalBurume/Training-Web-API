## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will begin implementing the API for HPlusSport with the simplest use case: retrieving data. Let's recap our setup so far:

1. **Project Creation**: We created a project using the ASP.NET Core Web API template.
2. **Controllers**: We ensured that we use controllers, which we will start with before migrating to minimal APIs later.
3. **OpenAPI Support**: Enabled to use Swagger UI for testing the API directly in the browser.

## Controllers Overview

### Initial Setup

- **Project Structure**: In our project, a default controller (`WeatherForecastController`) was created. This controller had a method `Get` for handling GET requests.
- **Execution Confirmation**: By running the application, we confirmed that data is returned when sending an HTTP GET request to the endpoint using the browser, Postman, or Swagger UI.

### Creating a Custom Controller

To create our own controller, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Controller Setup**: 
    - Controllers handle HTTP requests.
    - Each controller is a class ending in `Controller` and inherits from `ControllerBase` (not `Controller` which is for ASP.NET Core MVC).
    - Use the `[ApiController]` attribute for convenience features like content negotiation.

2. **Defining Methods**:
    - Methods like `Get` handle GET requests.
    - Use attributes like `[HttpGet]` to explicitly specify request handling methods.

## Implementation Steps

### Visual Studio Setup

1. **Create New Project**:
    - File → New Project → ASP.NET Core Web API template.
    - Name the project `HPlusSport.API` and the solution `HPlusSport`.

2. **Configuration**:
    - Enable OpenAPI support.
    - Ensure "Use controllers" is checked.
    - Create the project.

3. **Remove Unnecessary Code**:
    - Delete the `WeatherForecast` class and `WeatherForecastController`.

4. **Project Properties**:
    - Navigate to the properties folder and launch settings.
    - Remove IIS support and use Kestrel web server.
    - Configure HTTP (port 5222) and HTTPS (port 7201) settings.
    - Remove IIS Express.

### Creating the First Controller

1. **Add New Controller**:
    - Right-click the Controllers folder → Add → New Controller.
    - Select "API Controller - Empty" for a basic setup.
    - Name the controller `ProductsController`.

2. **Controller Code**:
    - The class will derive from `ControllerBase`.
    - Use the `[ApiController]` attribute.
    - Define a method `GetProducts` with the `[HttpGet]` attribute for handling GET requests.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace HPlusSport.API.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public void GetProducts()
        {
            // Implementation will go here
      
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

We've set up the basic structure for our HPlusSport API with an empty controller. In the next steps, we will implement the functionality to retrieve and manage products data, exploring various attributes and methods in depth.
