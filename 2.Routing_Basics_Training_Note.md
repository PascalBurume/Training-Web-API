# Routing Basics

---

## Overview

One missing ingredient is routing, or routing depending on where you live. Routing determines which URL maps to which endpoint, method, or action method, and of course, to which controller.

## Routing with Attributes

### Basic Route Attribute

- **Simple Example**: 
    - `[Route("/products")]`
    - Maps the `/products` URL to the following method.

### Using Parameters

- **Example with Parameters**: 
    - `[Route("/products/{id}")]`
    - Calling `/products/42` will route to the method with a parameter `id`, where `id` will be 42.

- **Optional Parameters**:
    - `[Route("/products/{id?}")]`
    - Makes `id` optional. If not specified, the route still works.

### Placeholder for Controller Name

- **Placeholder**: 
    - `[controller]` is a placeholder for the controller name.
    - For `ProductsController`, `[controller]` becomes `products`.

### Example Code

Let's review the example code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace HPlusSport.API.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public string GetProducts()
        {
            return "OK";
        }
    }
}
```

- **Base Route**: 
    - `[Route("api/[controller]")]`
    - Becomes `api/products` since the controller is `ProductsController`.

### Testing the Route

1. **Build and Run**: 
    - Build the project and run it.
    - Swagger UI will launch in the browser.

2. **Validate the Endpoint**: 
    - The endpoint `api/products` should return `OK`.

3. **Inspecting the Response**: 
    - Check the network tab to see the request and response.
    - `Content-Type` will be `text/plain` for string responses.

## Conclusion

We've covered the basics of routing in ASP.NET Core using attributes, handling parameters, and testing the setup. In the next steps, we will implement more elaborate real-world data and explore how to handle different content types.
