- **Example Usage:**
    - Open the browser and navigate to the API endpoint.
    - Press F12 to open DevTools.
    - Go to the "Network" tab and refresh the page to capture requests.
    - Inspect the request details and response data.

### 3. Fiddler

- **Overview:**
    - A proxy tool that captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
    - Useful for debugging web applications and APIs.
    - Available at [telerik.com/fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler).

- **Features:**
    - Capture and inspect all HTTP traffic between the client and server.
    - View and modify request and response headers, bodies, and cookies.
    - Script requests for advanced testing scenarios.

- **Example Usage:**
    - Install and open Fiddler.
    - Configure Fiddler to capture traffic.
    - Interact with the API to capture requests.
    - Inspect and modify the captured traffic.

## Practical Application

### Using Postman for API Testing

- **Setup:**
    - Download and install Postman from [getpostman.com](https://www.getpostman.com).
    - Open Postman and create a new request.

- **Creating a Request:**
    - Enter the API endpoint URL.
    - Select the HTTP method (e.g., GET).
    - Add any required headers or body data.
    - Click "Send" to execute the request.

- **Inspecting the Response:**
    - View the JSON response with syntax highlighting.
    - Check the HTTP status code and headers.
    - Save the request for future use.

### Example Code

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/products",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

## Key Points

- Postman is a versatile tool specifically suited for API testing.
