# REST Basics

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) and its importance in designing APIs.

## Key Concepts

1. **Origin of REST:**
    - REST was introduced by Roy Fielding in his PhD dissertation in 2000.
    - REST is a design concept, not a technology, and it leverages existing infrastructure.

2. **Using HTTP:**
    - REST is built on top of HTTP and utilizes its features.
    - URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used to access resources.
    - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to perform operations on resources.

3. **Architectural Constraints:**
    - Fielding defined six constraints for RESTful APIs:
        1. **Uniform Interface:** Simplifies and decouples the architecture.
        2. **Client-Server:** Ensures independence between client and server.
        3. **Stateless:** Each request from the client must contain all the information needed by the server to fulfill the request.
        4. **Cacheable:** Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to improve performance.
        5. **Layered System:** Supports a layered architecture where each layer communicates only with the next immediate layer.
        6. **Code on Demand (optional):** Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Uniform Interface

- **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):**
    - Resources should contain links to related resources.
    - Example: A category resource may include links to items in that category.

### 2. Client-Server

- **Independence:**
    - Client and server can evolve independently without breaking the API.
    - Ensures scalability and flexibility.

### 3. Stateless

- **Self-contained Requests:**
    - Each client request must contain all necessary information.
    - Server does not store any context about the client between requests.

### 4. Cacheable

- **Performance Improvement:**
    - Responses should explicitly state their cacheability.
    - Caching can reduce the number of client-server interactions.

### 5. Layered System

- **Separation of Concerns:**
    - Supports multiple layers in the architecture.
    - Each layer interacts only with its adjacent layer, enhancing security and scalability.

### 6. Code on Demand (Optional)

- **Extending Client Functionality:**
    - Servers can send executable code to clients.
    - Common in web applications through JavaScript.

## Practical Application

### Implementing RESTful APIs

- **Define Resources:**
    - Identify and model resources (e.g., users, products, orders).

- **Use HTTP Methods:**
    - GET: Retrieve resources.
    - POST: Create new resources.
    - PUT: Update existing resources.
    - DELETE: Remove resources.

- **Design URIs:**
    - Structure URIs to represent resources and their relationships.
    - Example: `/api/products` for a collection of products, `/api/products/{id}` for a specific product.

### Example Code

### Program.cs

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/products", () =>
{
    var products = new[]
    {
        new Product(1, "Product 1", 100),
        new Product(2, "Product 2", 200)
    };
    return products;
});

app.MapGet("/products/{id}", (int id) =>
{
    var product = new Product(id, $"Product {id}", id * 100);
    return product != null ? Results.Ok(product) : Results.NotFound();
});

app.MapPost("/products", (Product product) =>
{
    // Code to create a new product
    return Results.Created($"/products/{product.Id}", product);
});

app.MapPut("/products/{id}", (int id, Product updatedProduct) =>
{
    // Code to update an existing product
    return Results.NoContent();
});

app.MapDelete("/products/{id}", (int id) =>
{
    // Code to delete a product
    return Results.NoContent();
});

app.Run();

public record Product(int Id, string Name, decimal Price);
```

## Key Points

- REST is a design paradigm for network-based software architectures.
- It uses HTTP methods and URIs to perform operations on resources.
- Adhering to REST constraints improves scalability, performance, and maintainability of APIs.
- Implementing RESTful APIs involves defining resources, designing URIs, and using appropriate HTTP methods.

By understanding REST basics and its constraints, you'll be better prepared to design and implement robust and scalable APIs.
