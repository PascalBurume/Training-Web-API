# Training Web API Project

Welcome to the Training Web API project! This repository contains all the necessary materials and documentation for building and deploying a web API using .NET 8 and C#. The project is designed to guide you through the process of creating a robust web API, leveraging the latest features and best practices in .NET technology.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in developing web APIs with .NET 8, focusing on practical applications and real-world scenarios. By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional web API that can be deployed to serve real users.
